1.  The getrusage() function gives the total overview system or kernel resource usage
    of the following three parameters:
            >>RUSAGE_SELF
            >>RUSAGE_CHILDREN
            >>RUSAGE_THREAD
            
2.  Total 16 stuctures' members in struct rusage data type:   

            struct rusage 
            {
               struct timeval ru_utime; 
               struct timeval ru_stime; 
               long   ru_maxrss;       
               long   ru_ixrss;         
               long   ru_idrss;        
               long   ru_isrss;        
               long   ru_minflt;        
               long   ru_majflt;        
               long   ru_nswap;         
               long   ru_inblock;      
               long   ru_oublock;      
               long   ru_msgsnd;        
               long   ru_msgrcv;       
               long   ru_nsignals;      
               long   ru_nvcsw;         
               long   ru_nivcsw;       
           };

            
3.  Otherwise we have to pass whole struct which is huge pained and uncompromizing
    and pass by reference we can just simply pass the base memory address
    so-called reference.
    
4.  After opening and checking that the file has opened, the for loop iterates until the EOF, or end or file,
    marker is reached. C is initialized with the first character from the file, pointed to by fp.
    Each iteration of the for loop causes C to be assigned the value of the next character in the file. 

    Each character, contained in variable C, is checked to ensure it is a letter or an apostrophe,
    as long as the apostrophe does not appear at the beginning of the word. If it is a letter, 
    the character will be inserted into the WORD array at the INDEX position. 
    After this happens INDEX is incremented to go to the next position in the array. 

    If the size of INDEX exceeds the maximum permitted size of a word, 
    as defined by LENGTH, the program will cycle to the end of the word
    and start looking for the next word, by resetting index to 0.
    The same thing is done if a number is found, within a word or on its own. 

    If the array contains no numbers, starting apostrophes, and is below the maximum length of a word,
    it must be a word so it is given a null terminator. While being timed, the word is checked for misspellings.
    If it is not found in the dictionary, 
    the word is printed out and the total number of misspellings caught is increased by 1.    


5.  fgetc is a more effective tool for examining 1 character at a time,
    to check that it is a valid letter. fscanf, by default, 
    ignores whitespace, which we can use with fgetc to identify the end of a word. 
    
    so to read one single character from a file is sometimes buggy if use fscanf

6.  load and check declared as const parameter to make it read only memory

7.  I have implemented hash table to do spell-check ...
    Hash tables is the array of buckets of node pointers nodes...
    and each node pointers hold linked lists
    and each linked list's nodes there are words
    
8.  approximately good enough when my code worked correctly

9.  I think good hash function may improve my spell-checker performance

10. Yes, I think
